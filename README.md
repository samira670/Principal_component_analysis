The Jupyter notebook illustrates how to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using Python libraries. It begins by importing necessary packages such as pandas, numpy, and sklearn. The notebook loads a dataset, applies PCA using sklearn's PCA function, and fits the model to reduce the dataset's dimensionality. The principal components are extracted to explain the variance in the data, and results are visualized through plots and heatmaps to display the contribution of each component. This PCA application helps in understanding data structures and reducing features without losing significant information, ideal for data pre-processing or exploratory data analysis.
